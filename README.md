## Key Optimizations

- **Memoization** — GameCard and reusable components memoized for render performance
- **Lazy Loading** — Images loaded lazily with `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"`
- **Code Splitting** — TanStack Router with pending states and preload delays
- **Prefetching** — Next pages prefetched for infinite scroll smoothness
- **Staggered Animations** — Efficient Framer Motion variants for list animations
- **Preconnect** — API and image domains preconnected for faster fetches

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support (Escape, Arrow keys, Enter)
- Focus visible states on all interactive elements
- Color contrast compliant with WCAG guidelines
- Screen reader friendly (sr-only labels, proper roles)
